### ⚙️ **Who Am I:**

I’m Psy — a multi-talented creator building the future one bot, beat, and idea at a time. From Discord automation to digital art to music, I push boundaries on and off the board. Creativity isn’t a hobby for me… it’s the lifestyle. 🔥

### 🤖 **What I Do:**

I design and run multi-bot networks like **Ludus**, **Pax**, **Vilicous**, and the upcoming **Conditor** — each one crafted to evolve Discord automation, robotics, and user experience.
My mission? To inspire devs, gamers, and creatives to think bigger with the power of AI. 🚀
