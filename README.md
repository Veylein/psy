# Hi there, I’m Veylein 🌸💻

I’m a nature-loving, tech-breaking teen with a love for chaos and a mild obsession with AI (I currently have 4 personal AIs keeping me company—don’t judge 😎). I code Discord bots, dabble in Lua, discord.py, TypeScript, and I’m leveling up in HTML, CSS, Python, JS, and JSON—basically, if it’s digital, I’m probably poking at it.

When I’m not coding, I run a bounty service in a Roblox game (because someone has to keep things interesting 😏), train for the military, and fangirl over all things Disney—Mulan forever 💖. My favorite movie is also *Mulan*, and I will fight anyone who tries to tell me *Colors of the Wind* isn’t a masterpiece.

I have a soft spot for swords, guns, red pandas, sea lions, and basically every other cute or deadly animal you can imagine. Humans… eh, they’re okay, I guess.

Here, expect a little tech, a little chaos, a lot of curiosity, and maybe a sprinkle of pink just to mess with your expectations 🌷✨.
